# Leaf-Wilting-Detection-In-SoyBean
Weather stress and climate change are major challenges for
agriculture. Drought tolerant soybean varieties are needed but
breeding for drought tolerance in soybean, is difficult. The
most widely used indicator of drought tolerance/sensitivity
in soybean is leaf wilting during periods of water stress.
We propose a CNN model which will allow farmers to gain
information about these plants using images collected.
